  I'm terrible at writing about pages

  So my name is Bas. I'm living in the town of Bergen op Zoom, which is in the south of the Netherlands. I'm currently a Oracle Fusion Middleware consultant for Qualogy. I currently also have a focus on infrastructure and automation with Puppet, Amazon Web Services, Docker and Linux.

<p>
  I've started out working remote techical support for J.D. Edwards. Due to the fact that this ERP suite is running on a lot of systems, I gained experience with all kind of operating systems, databases, application servers. I also got a lot of exposure in managing incidents and keeping customers happy
</p>

<p>
  After doing this for over 7 years, I decided I wanted to be a consultant. I became a Oracle Fusion Middleware consultant with a focus on WebLogic currently working for Qualogy. Next to WebLogic, I also have a huge interest in infrastructure in general and new technologies. In my current assignment I am helping my main customer in moving to a fast paced infrastructure with use of Agile methods in a DevOps culture.

  As the world is moving fast, and IT is moving even faster, I decided to start this blog in the middle of 2015. The main purpose of this blog is to share knowledge with.. myself. Writing it down allows me to forget the details, and makes room to learn even more. ;-)
